This is an ecommerce website built with Django. Users can add and remove products to/from their cart while also specifying the quantity of each item and can proceed to checkout. The website is about selling products derived from plastics such as: Cushions, Sofas, Tiles, Bricks and many more. The aim of this website is to reduce CO2 emission by recycling plastics and transform those raw materials into useful products that can last.
